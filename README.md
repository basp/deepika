## Overview
This is very much a work in progress. The following stuff is *blissfully* implemented:

* basic database (`db-sig.rkt` and `db-unit.rkt`)
* task queue (`task-queue.rkt`)
* command parser (`parser.rkt` and `parser-test.rkt`)
* common infrastructure such as `objid` and friends (`common.rkt`)
